# The table of Ohio county auditor sites that run the Tyler iasWorld platform.
# Adding a county is a config entry here (plus a fixture-backed contract test and
# a sample) — the scraping/canonical logic lives in titlemcp-platform-iasworld.
#
# Counties confirmed on iasWorld but not yet enabled (need a captured fixture):
# Montgomery, Stark, Butler, Lucas, Summit, Lake. See
# docs/OHIO_AUDITOR_EXPANSION.md for the rollout order and platform recon.

# Clermont is the same iasWorld /_web/ stack as Franklin, but two things differ,
# both confirmed against live data: parcels are alphanumeric ("100200C003D") so
# numeric_parcel_ids=False, and its datalet detail uses the "Public Access" split
# section layout (Parcel/Owner/Tax Mailing/Legal/Taxes Charged) rather than
# Franklin's combined-Owner layout. Both are handled by config — no new scraper.
